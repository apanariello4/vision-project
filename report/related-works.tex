\section{Related Works}
To perform the tasks of this work, we exploited some previous work in this field. We used YOLOv3 neural network \cite{yolov3} for the detection trained with darknet \cite{darknet}. We also compare another pipeline, without neural network, in which we preprocess the image with adaptive threshold, median blur \cite{median-blur} and opening, to then apply the Connected Component Labeling (BBDT) \cite{Grana_ccl}. Retrieval uses ORB \cite{orb} with Lowe's ratio test \cite{sift}. In the last part we detect faces with the Haar Cascade classifiers~\cite{haar_cascade}.
