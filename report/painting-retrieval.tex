\section{Painting Retrieval}
Painting retrieval uses ORB~\cite{orb} keypoints detector and descriptor to find matches between two images. ORB, aka "Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF", is at two orders of magnitude faster than the old used SIFT~\cite{sift} and this is the main reason why we choose to use this method in order to achieve the painting retrieval with a good performance/results ratio.
